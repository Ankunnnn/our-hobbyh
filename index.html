       <p style="font-size: 30px; margin-left:50px ">Table tennis is also known as ping-pong and whiff-whaff. Two or four players hit a ball back and forth across a table using small solid rackets. Spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits an opponent's options, giving the hitter a great advantage.</p>
